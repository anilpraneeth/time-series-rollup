# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Time Series Rollup System?
The Time Series Rollup System is a PostgreSQL-based solution for efficiently managing and aggregating time-series data. It's specifically designed for AWS RDS and Aurora PostgreSQL environments where extensions like pg_timeseries and pg_timescaledb are not supported.

### Why should I use this system?
- Designed specifically for AWS RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL
- Provides efficient time-series data management
- Offers flexible rollup strategies
- Includes comprehensive monitoring and error handling
- Supports concurrent processing

### What are the main features?
- Exponential rollup for efficient data aggregation
- Adaptive processing windows
- Dimension-based aggregation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built-in performance monitoring
- Concurrent processing support

## Technical Questions

### What PostgreSQL version is required?
PostgreSQL 12 or higher is required. The system is specifically tested and optimized for AWS RDS PostgreSQL 12+ and Aurora PostgreSQL 12+.

### What extensions are required?
The following extensions are required:
- pg_partman (for partitioning)
- ltree (for hierarchical data)
- btree_gin (for GIN index support)
- hypopg (for hypothetical indexes)
- pg_cron (for scheduled tasks)

### How do I install the required extensions?
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_partman;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gin;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hypopg;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I create my first rollup table?
```sql
SELECT silver.create_rollup_table(
    source_table_name := 'your_source_table',
    target_table_name := 'your_target_table',
    rollup_interval := '1 hour',
    look_back_window := '7 days'
);
```

### How do I monitor the rollup process?
```sql
-- Check detailed statistics
SELECT * FROM silver.get_detailed_stats('your_table_pattern');

-- Monitor partition statistics
SELECT * FROM silver.get_partition_stats('your_table_name');

-- View error logs
SELECT * FROM silver.timeseries_error_log
WHERE error_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### How do I handle errors?
The system provides comprehensive error handling:
1. Check the error logs
2. Review the [Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting)
3. Monitor the error rates
4. Implement retry mechanisms

## Performance Questions

### How do I optimize performance?
1. Adjust partition sizes
2. Fine-tune rollup intervals
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Use appropriate indexes
5. Regular maintenance

### What monitoring tools are available?
- Built-in performance monitoring
- Partition statistics
- Error tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Query performance analysis

## Security Questions

### What permissions are required?
The system requires:
- Usage on cron and partman schemas
- SELECT and INSERT permissions on configuration tables
- Appropriate database user permissions

### How do I secure the system?
1. Use principle of least privilege
2. Regular security audits
3. Secure credential management
4. Monitor access patterns
