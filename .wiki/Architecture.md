# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### 1. Schema Structure

The system is organized into four main schemas:

#### raw
- Contains the original time-series data
- Optimized for high-frequency data ingestion
- Partitioned by time for efficient data management

#### silver
- Contains processed and normalized data
- Implements rollup logic and data transformation
- Manages intermediate aggregation states

#### gold
- Contains final aggregated data
- Optimized for query performance
- Implements final rollup strategies

#### partman
- Manages table partitioning
- Handles partition maintenance
- Controls partition lifecycle

### 2. Core Components

#### Time Bucket Functions
- Efficient timestamp bucketing
- Supports multiple time intervals
- Optimized for performance

#### Value Functions
- First/last value aggregation
- Statistical calculations
- Custom aggregation support

#### Rollup Management
- Table creation and configuration
- Processing window management
- Concurrent operation handling

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Retry mechanisms
- Error recovery procedures

#### Performance Monitoring
- System health tracking
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Raw data enters the `raw` schema
   - Data is partitioned by time
   - Initial validation and cleaning

2. **Processing**
   - Data moves to `silver` schema
   - Rollup operations performed
   - Intermediate aggregations created

3. **Aggregation**
   - Final aggregation in `gold` schema
   - Data optimization
   - Query performance tuning

4. **Maintenance**
   - Partition management
   - Data archival
   - Performance optimization

## Performance Considerations

### Partitioning Strategy
