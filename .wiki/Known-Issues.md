# Known Issues

This page lists known issues, limitations, and workarounds for the Time Series Rollup System.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Partition Management

**Issue:** Large partition sizes can impact performance
**Status:** Under Investigation
**Workaround:** 
- Monitor partition sizes using `silver.get_partition_stats()`
- Adjust partition intervals based on data volume
- Regular maintenance of old partitions

### 2. Concurrent Processing

**Issue:** High concurrency can cause deadlocks
**Status:** Known Issue
**Workaround:**
- Implement proper locking strategies
- Use appropriate transaction isolation levels
- Monitor deadlock rates

### 3. Memory Usage

**Issue:** High memory consumption during large rollups
**Status:** Under Investigation
**Workaround:**
- Adjust batch sizes
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement memory limits

## Version-Specific Issues

### Version 1.0.0

#### Performance Issues
- Slow rollup processing for large datasets
- High CPU usage during aggregation
- Memory spikes during partition creation

#### Data Consistency
- Potential gaps in data during high load
- Incomplete rollup results under certain conditions
- Missing time periods in edge cases

#### Extension Compatibility
- Issues with certain pg_partman versions
- Conflicts with other partitioning tools
- Extension version dependencies

## Workarounds

### 1. Performance Optimization

```sql
-- Adjust batch size for better performance
UPDATE silver.timeseries_rollup_config
SET batch_size = 10000
WHERE source_table_name = 'your_table';

-- Optimize partition sizes
SELECT partman.optimize_partition('your_table');
```

### 2. Data Consistency

```sql
-- Verify data consistency
SELECT silver.verify_data_consistency('your_table');

-- Repair missing data
SELECT silver.repair_missing_data('your_table');
```

### 3. Memory Management

```sql
-- Set memory limits
SET work_mem = '256MB';
SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';

-- Monitor memory usage
SELECT * FROM silver.get_memory_stats();
```
